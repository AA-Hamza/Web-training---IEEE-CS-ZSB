            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941. October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist. 
                He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system and B programming language.
                 Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999. Ritchie was the head of 
                 Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. 
                 He was the "R" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username dmr. </p>

            <h3>The C Programming Language</h3>
            <p>Ritchie is best known as the creator of the C programming language, a key developer of the Unix operating system, and co-author of the book The C Programming Language;
                he was the 'R' in K&R (a common reference to the book's authors Kernighan and Ritchie). Ritchie worked together with Ken Thompson,
                 who is credited with writing the original version of Unix; one of Ritchie's most important contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms.
                They were so influential on Research Unix that Doug McIlroy later wrote, "The names of Ritchie and Thompson may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed.

            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>Ritchie was found dead on October 12, 2011, at the age of 70 at his home in Berkeley Heights, 
                New Jersey, where he lived alone. First news of his death came from his former colleague, 
                Rob Pike. The cause and exact time of death have not been disclosed. He had been in frail health for several years following treatment for prostate 
                cancer and heart disease. News of Ritchie's death was largely overshadowed by 
                <em>the media coverage of the death of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, which occurred the week 
                    before.</em>
